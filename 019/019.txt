Solved this in 2 ways:

1) Trial and Error:
There are 1200 months total in 100 years.
There should be around 1200 / 7 = 171 Sundays on the 1st.
So I planned to try 171, 172, 170... until correct. It tuned out the 1st trial gave the correct answer.

2) Linux bash shell + a bunch of shell utilities

for x in `seq 1901 2000`; do 
for y in `seq 1 12`; do 
cal $y $x; 
done 
done |grep '^ 1' |wc -1
