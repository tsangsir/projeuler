918273645 is 1 to 9 pandigital, but rejected as answer 
=> Answer must start with at least 91
=> Answer cannot start with 95 or above, because 95*2 will have another 9, conflict with leading 9

For 2-digit number, 9n
9n * 1 => 2 digit; 9n * 2 => 3 digit; 9n * 4 => 3 digit; 9n * 5 => 3 digits
=> Cannot be an answer because product concatentation will not be 9 digit

Similarly, 3-digit numbers are rejected

Answer must be 4-digit, because for 5-digit, the concatenated product will have > 9 digit

For 4-digit numbers, the answer should satisfy
- between 9487 and 9183
- has no 1, 8 (so starting point become 9476), which will be produced when multipy with 2
- has no 0, by definition 
- has no 5, which produces 0 when multiple with 2


By trial and error, answer was found
